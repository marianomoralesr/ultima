# Quick Start: Fix Supabase Egress in 15 Minutes

This guide gets you from **250GB egress** to **70-90% reduction** in about 15 minutes.

---

## What We're Doing

Installing a Cloudflare Worker that sits between your users and Supabase storage, caching all images at Cloudflare's edge network. This means:

- **Users get images from Cloudflare** (fast, free egress)
- **Supabase only serves uncached images** (70-90% reduction)
- **No code changes required initially** (we've already prepared the code)

---

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install Wrangler CLI for Cloudflare Workers
npm install -g wrangler

# Install AWS SDK for future R2 support
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login
```

### 2. Configure & Deploy Worker (5 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to worker directory
cd cloudflare-workers

# Edit wrangler.toml and add your Cloudflare Account ID
# Get it from: https://dash.cloudflare.com (look in URL or Account Home)
nano wrangler.toml
```

Update the `account_id` line:
```toml
account_id = "your-account-id-here"
```

Deploy:
```bash
wrangler deploy
```

### 3. Set Up Custom Domain (3 minutes)

**Option 1: Cloudflare Dashboard (Easier)**
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com > Workers & Pages
2. Click `trefa-image-proxy`
3. Click "Triggers" tab
4. Click "Add Custom Domain"
5. Enter: `images.trefa.mx`
6. Click "Add Custom Domain"

Cloudflare will automatically:
- Create DNS records
- Issue SSL certificate
- Route traffic to your worker

**Option 2: CLI**
```bash
# Edit wrangler.toml and uncomment routes section
routes = [
  { pattern = "images.trefa.mx/*", zone_name = "trefa.mx" }
]

# Redeploy
wrangler deploy
```

### 4. Test Worker (2 minutes)

```bash
# Health check
curl https://images.trefa.mx/health
# Expected: OK

# Test image (first load - cache MISS)
curl -I https://images.trefa.mx/fotos_airtable/app/suv-2Artboard-12-trefa.png | grep -i "x-cache-status"
# Expected: X-Cache-Status: MISS

# Test again (should be cached - cache HIT)
curl -I https://images.trefa.mx/fotos_airtable/app/suv-2Artboard-12-trefa.png | grep -i "x-cache-status"
# Expected: X-Cache-Status: HIT
```

**If both tests pass, your CDN is working!**

### 5. Configure Application (3 minutes)

```bash
# Back to project root
cd ..

# Create/update .env.local
echo "VITE_IMAGE_CDN_URL=https://images.trefa.mx" >> .env.local
```

**IMPORTANT**: Also set this in your deployment environment:

For Cloud Run staging:
```bash
gcloud run services update app-staging \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --update-env-vars=VITE_IMAGE_CDN_URL=https://images.trefa.mx
```

For Cloud Run production:
```bash
gcloud run services update app \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --update-env-vars=VITE_IMAGE_CDN_URL=https://images.trefa.mx
```

### 6. Deploy & Test (5 minutes)

```bash
# Deploy to staging
./docs/deployment/deploy.sh staging

# Once deployed, test in browser
# Open: https://app-staging-dqfqiqyola-uc.a.run.app

# Open browser DevTools > Network tab
# Reload page and check image URLs
# They should load from: images.trefa.mx (not jjepfehmuybpctdzipnu.supabase.co)
```

**If images load from images.trefa.mx, success!**

Deploy to production:
```bash
./docs/deployment/deploy.sh production
```

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify everything is working:

- [ ] Worker health check returns OK: `curl https://images.trefa.mx/health`
- [ ] Images load from CDN: Check Network tab in browser DevTools
- [ ] Second load shows cache HIT: `curl -I https://images.trefa.mx/fotos_airtable/app/suv-2Artboard-12-trefa.png`
- [ ] Staging site images load correctly
- [ ] Production site images load correctly

---

## Monitor Results

### Day 1: Check Cloudflare Analytics
1. Go to: Cloudflare Dashboard > Workers & Pages > trefa-image-proxy > Metrics
2. Look for:
   - **Requests**: Should see traffic
   - **Cache Hit Ratio**: Will start low, should climb to 85-95% within 24 hours

### Day 2-3: Check Supabase Usage
1. Go to: Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Usage
2. Look at "Egress" graph
3. **Expected**: 70-90% reduction compared to before

### Week 1: Verify Savings
- Monitor daily egress in Supabase
- **Before**: ~75-100GB/day
- **After**: ~7-30GB/day
- **Savings**: ~$5-10/day = **$150-300/month**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Worker deployed but images still loading from Supabase

**Issue**: Environment variable not set
```bash
# Check if variable is set
gcloud run services describe app-staging --region=us-central1 | grep VITE_IMAGE_CDN_URL

# If not found, set it
gcloud run services update app-staging \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --update-env-vars=VITE_IMAGE_CDN_URL=https://images.trefa.mx

# Redeploy
./docs/deployment/deploy.sh staging
```

### Images returning 404 from CDN

**Issue**: URL format mismatch

Check your image URL structure. The CDN expects:
```
https://images.trefa.mx/fotos_airtable/app/image.png
```

NOT:
```
https://images.trefa.mx/storage/v1/object/public/fotos_airtable/app/image.png
```

The worker automatically strips `/storage/v1/object/public/`.

### Cache always showing MISS

**Issue**: Cache not working properly

1. Check Worker logs:
   ```bash
   # In Cloudflare Dashboard > Workers & Pages > trefa-image-proxy > Logs Real-time
   ```

2. Verify cache headers:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://images.trefa.mx/fotos_airtable/app/suv-2Artboard-12-trefa.png
   # Should show:
   # cache-control: public, max-age=604800, s-maxage=2592000
   ```

3. Try purging Cloudflare cache:
   - Cloudflare Dashboard > Caching > Configuration
   - Click "Purge Everything"
   - Wait 5 minutes and test again

---

## Next Steps

Once the CDN is working and you see egress reduction:

1. **Week 2**: Set up Cloudflare R2 for new uploads (see `IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md`)
2. **Week 3**: Optionally enable Image Resizing for WebP conversion
3. **Week 4**: Monitor and optimize further

**Need detailed information?** See `docs/IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md`

---

## Emergency Rollback

If something breaks and you need to roll back:

```bash
# Remove environment variable
gcloud run services update app \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --remove-env-vars=VITE_IMAGE_CDN_URL

# Redeploy
./docs/deployment/deploy.sh production
```

Images will go back to loading directly from Supabase.
